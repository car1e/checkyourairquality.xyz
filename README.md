MYP COMMMUNITY PROJECT

These are the files that contain all of the code for my Air Quality site.
The website was created using three programming languages:
HTML - backbone of the site. If I want to create a body paragraph or title on the site, I would use this programming language.
Javascript - essential part of the site. Without Javascript, I wouldn't be able to use the API and wouldn't be able to display the information regarding air quality.
CSS - less essential but makes the website look nicer. I used CSS to change the color, font, font-thickness, spacing between words, etc.
