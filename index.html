            Hello!
            My name is Carl-Henry Kamp and I am a student at La Scuola International in San Francisco, California
             <br>and am graduating in 2024.
            <br>
            <br>This site is part of something called the Middle Years Program project,
             or MYP project for short, in which design a project in order to help a community.
             <br>I chose to create a website, in order to make information about air quality more accessible
             <br>to people who require it. Such as people with conditions such as asthma or COPD.
             <br>
             <br>Here's a little backstory:
             <br>In December of 2023, I moved to a small village in the northeast of Italy called Tarvisio.
             <br>I moved to Tarvisio in order to continue ski racing at a very high level, which was no
             <br>longer possible in the United States.
        </p>
            <img src="https://www.turismofvg.it/proxyvfs.axd/image_hd/r78057/img_ricerca_inverno-jpg?v=119905&ext=.jpg" alt="picture of Tarvisio village"
           width="640"
           height="360"
                />
            <p>
                Image of Tarvisio ^^^
                <br>Although everything was nice, there was one major issue: the air quality.
                <br>Every single time you took a breath, you could taste the air pollution.
                <br>This made me curious; how is the air pollution so bad? What are the causes? And how does this affect me and the village?
                <br>
                <br>This curiosity is what led me to choosing air quality and it's connection with your health for my MYP project.
                <br>This site is my action for the MYP and my goal is to make information regarding air quality and its affects on your health
                <br>more clear and simple to understand.
            </p>
